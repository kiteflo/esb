1. General Midjourney introduction

Use the following info as a reference to create ideal Midjourney prompts:
• Focus on clear and concise descriptions, with different concepts separated by commas, then follow them with any parameters. Parameters are not separated by commas.
• Be specific and vivid: Describe every single aspect of the image, including: Subject, Style, Color, Medium, Composition, Lighting, Shadows, Mood, Environment, Time Era, Perspective, Depth of Field, Textures, Scale and Proportions, Foreground, Midground, Background, Weather, Material Properties, Time of Day, Motion or Stillness, Season, Cultural Context, Architectural Style, Patterns and Repetition, Emotions and Expressions, Clothing and Accessories, Setting, Reflections or Transparency, Interactions among Subjects, Symbolism, Light Source and Direction, Art Techniques or Mediums, Artistic Style or in the Style of a Specific Artist, Contrasting Elements, Framing or Compositional Techniques, Imaginary or Fictional Elements, Dominant Color Palette, and any other relevant context.
• Aim for rich and elaborate prompts: Provide ample detail to capture the essence of the desired image and use the examples below as a reference to craft intricate and comprehensive prompts which allow Midjourney to generate images with high accuracy and fidelity.
• For photos, Incorporate relevant camera settings like focal length, aperture, ISO, & shutter speed. Specify high-end lenses such as Sony G Master, Canon L Series, Zeiss Otus series for higher quality images.
• Select the aspect ratio by adding the --ar <value>:<value> parameter. Choose suitable aspect ratios for portraits (9:16, 3:4, 2:3) and landscapes (16:9, 2:1, 3:2), considering the composition and desired to frame.
• Exclude elements with --no: Add --no followed by the unwanted element to exclude it from the image, ensuring the final output aligns with your vision. Use this only if there’s a high likelihood of something showing up in the image that we don’t want.
• Diversify your prompts: Explore various styles, moods, colours, art mediums, and aspect ratios to create a wide range of visually appealing and unique images.

2. Info about new model version V5

Here is more info about Midjourney AI and its new model V5. The following are some of the new features that have been added to the latest version:
• More stylistic range and more responsive to prompting
• Higher image quality (2x resolution increase)
• Improved dynamic range
• More detailed images
• Less unwanted text
• Improved performance with image prompting
• Supports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)
• Supports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)
• Supports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts

3. Basic Parameters:

• Aspect Ratios
--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

• Chaos
--chaos <number 0–100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.

• No
--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.

• Quality
--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.

• Seed
--seed <integer between 0–4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the — seed or — same seed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

• Stop
--stop <integer between 10–100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

• Style
--style <4a, 4b or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4

• Stylize
--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney’s default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.

• Uplight
--uplight Use an alternative “light” upscale when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.
